# code-aster-examples
A number of examples for the open-source Finite Element Solver [Code_Aster](https://www.code-aster.org/) and [Salome_Meca](https://www.code-aster.org/spip.php?article303)

## Examplessss

Each folder contains a `.med` file with the mesh of the structure and a `.comm` file with the command file for Code_Aster. With these files anyone shoulf be able to reproduce the analyses with or without Salome_Meca. See the [IFC2CA video](https://youtu.be/V9Pc7SJvuRg) if you want to see how to reproduce the analyses with asterStudy, a dedicated module of Salome_Meca.

[Tutorial 13 - Modal Analysis with Solid Elements](Tutorial_13): perform a modal analysis of a 3D model with solid elements.

[Define Local Axes for 1D Elements](DefineLocalAxes1D): Define the orientation of the local axes of 1D elements in Code_Aster and extract this information in the result file, then visualize the local axes in Paraview
- [Video](https://youtu.be/FUiFjAtCyX0)

[Define Custom Beam Profile](CustomBeamProfile): Define a custom profile for beam elements given that these properties are calculated beforehand or extracted from a table. Extract not only the generalized forces but also the maximum stresses for each type of response
- [Video](https://youtu.be/uZBcvgoby54)

[Composite Shells](CompositeShellExample): Define a composite shell with an arbitrary number of layers, orhtotropic materials and arbitrary material directions and extract generalized forces and stress for a specific layer. BONUS: Example is performed with a Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) panel
- [Video](https://youtu.be/52INSrQ48iQ)

[Parametric Study](ParametricStudyExample): Setup and perform a parametric analysis based on the composite shell example and by modifying the orientation of the layers of the panel from an initial angle of 0 to a final angle of 90 degrees with a step of 10. This tutorial is based on modifying the command file with python outside the asterStudy module. It does not cover the case of a parametric geometry.

[Rod Example](RodExample): Perform a multi-step static analysis with material and geometric nonlinearity, using an elasto-plastic material model with kinematic hardening and a logarithmic strain for geometric nonlinearity in large deformations.
Moreover, use a Jupyter Lab notebook to do some basic pre- and post-processing based on the input and output files.

[Linear Dynamic Analysis Example](LDA-Example): Run a linear transient dynamic analysis of a building structure based on an acceleration ground-motion time-history, after performing a modal analysis and assigning a classical damping matrix based on user-defined damping ratios for each mode.
Moreover, use a Jupyter Lab notebook to do some basic post-processing based on the output test files that are created.

[Linear Dynamic Analysis Example with Modal Base](LDA-Modal-Example): Run a linear transient dynamic analysis of a building structure based on an acceleration ground-motion time-history, using a modal base of the structure; that is the mode shapes from a modal analysis. Modify the input file with respect to the standard dynamic analysis that uses a physical base to define the modal base, assign a classical damping matrix based on damping ratios for each mode, and restore back the results from the modal to the physical base, in order to extract the displacement time-histories in an external 'resu' file.

[Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis Example](NLDA-Example): Run a nonlinear transient dynamic analysis of a building structure with nonlinear discrete elements that allow uplifting and rocking of the structure at the base.

[Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis Example with Dynamic Sub-Structuring](NLDA-Modal-Example): Run a nonlinear transient dynamic analysis of a building structure with nonlinear discrete elements that allow uplifting and rocking of the structure at the base. The part of the structure that remains elastic is sub-structured in a super-element using the Craig-Bampton dynamic sub-structuring method.
